    					<h3>Jubilee Austen Project</h3>
    					<p>HTML5 & CSS Website</p>
    					<p>This website is a fake portfolio site. This is better than the Rogue Pickings one but still pretty basic. It's  one-page portfolio site for a person I assume is made up or someone who works at Skillcrush. The social media buttons don't go anywhere. </p>

    					<h3>Rogue Pickings Website</h3>
    					<p>HTML & CSS from Photoshop Design Comp</p>
    					<p>This was an exercise from a Skillcrush course in coding from a design comp in HTML & CSS. I did this eight months before I resumed these courses and pushed them to github. This is very simple as I was just learning. The links dont work but that wasnt the point of the exercise. </p>

    					<h3>My Original Website</h3>
    					<p>HTML & CSS/ Design</p>
    					<p>This was my first attempt at designing my own website. This project utilized everything I knew when I built it which was around 2016. This was the first website that I put up on my own domain name when I took my first Skillcrush class. </p>
